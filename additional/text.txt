'Illusive book shop' is a small, simple project done for GITA course. Here was used vanila javascript plus Jquery and little bit AJAX. 
It also uses local storage to save books that were added in home page and latter displays to books section. Used local storage so user doesnt add to main file and can have their own little book list.
Hope you like it.
